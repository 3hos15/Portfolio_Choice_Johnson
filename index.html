                        <p>I’ve explored various paths in my studies but ultimately found my place at CMD Amsterdam, where I truly feel at home.
                        </p>
                        <p>I’ve gained valuable experience through internships at large corporations, which have taught me a lot.

                        <p>In addition to being a full-time student, I work as a barista, a role that allows me to meet new people and help them.
