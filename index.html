                        <p>I’m a second year Communication & Multimedia Design student at the University of Applied Sciences. Aspiring to learn all I can, I’m ready to embark on a long journey surrounded by the Web.</p> 
                        <p>This portfolio website is based of an exsiting webiste I remade from scratch. I really loves the lay-out and complexity of it, hence why I used it for my portfolio.</p>

                        <p>Hi there! My name is Choice Johnson. I’m 21 years old and currently studying Communication & Multimedia Design at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam</p>
                        <p>I’ve explored various paths in my studies but ultimately found my place at CMD Amsterdam, where I truly feel at home.
                        </p>
                        <p>I’ve gained valuable experience through internships at large corporations, which have taught me a lot.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to being a full-time student, I work as a barista, a role that allows me to meet new people and help them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Feel free to contact me!</p>
